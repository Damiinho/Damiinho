### Hi there 👋

🌱 This is where I share my projects with other people.

#### ✨I have something like this here:
* Quite complex projects like <b>Election Map</b> 🗳️ with a political test or <b>Flag Finder</b> 🗺️ with a guessing game
*  Web games like <b>BrainGO!</b> 🧠
*  Simple applications using API such as <b>WeatherApp</b> ⛅ and <b>Wordle cheater</b> 🟩
*  Page templates in HTML5 and CSS3

 I write mainly in React. I'm slowly learning Node.js right now.

🔭 Feel free to check out my pinned apps.
